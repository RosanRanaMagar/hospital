  <h3>Our reponsibilites</h3>
  <p>Good organisation of care across the interface between general practice and secondary care (hospital) providers is crucial in ensuring that patients receive high-quality care and making the best use of NHS time and resources.</p>
  <h4>Onward referrals</h4>
  <span>Where a patient has been referred to a hospital clinic by the GP, or has presented as an emergency, the hospital clinician is obliged to make an onward outpatient referral to any other service, without the need for referral back to the GP, where either the onward referral is directly related to the condition for which the original referral was made (or which caused the emergency presentation), or if  the patient has an immediate need for investigation or treatment (suspected cancer, for instance). The hospital clinician is not able to refer onwards where a patient’s condition is non-urgent and where the condition for which the referral would be made is not directly related to the condition which caused the original GP referral or emergency presentation, and in that situation, the hospital clinician informs the patient’s GP. If the GP agrees, the onward referral can then be but the GP may instead choose to manage the patient’s condition an alternative way.</span>
<h4>Communicating with patients and responding to their queries</h4>
<p>It is important that providers take responsibility for managing and responding to queries received from patients. They are required to:

- put in place efficient arrangements for handling patient queries promptly and ensure that they respond properly to patient queries themselves, rather than simply passing them to GP practices to deal with

- communicate the results of investigations and tests carried out by themselves to patients directly, rather than relying on the practice to do so (except in the case of GP direct access diagnostic services)</p>
